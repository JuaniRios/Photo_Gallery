# Photo_Gallery

This is a website built on python, using Flask, SqlAlchemy, SQLite, and Face-Recognition as main libraries.
It is a Photo Gallery where you can upload your jpgs, and see them sorted by date, country, town, and faces.
It strips the metadata from the jpgs to get the location and date info, so be sure to upload the original jpgs and not ones redownloaded from other sources!

This is a project made for the Bachelor of Informatics at the IMC University of Applied Sciences in Krems, Austria.
